Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing , developing, testing, amd maintaing Software systems.
It is important because it ensures reliable, efficient, and scalable software solutions that meets user needs and drive innovation in the technology industry.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Nato Conference (1968)- invented the word Software Engineering to address the software crisis.
Structured Programming (1970)- introduced systematic approach to coding.
Agile Manifesto(2001)- Shifted focus to iterative development and customer collaboration.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Design - plan the system architecture and user interface.
Implementation- write the Code.
Testing - Check for bugs and errors.
Deployment - Release the software to users.
Maintenance - Fix issues and updates the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile- iterative, flexible approach. ideal for projects with evolving requirements for example developing a mobile app.
waterfall- liner, sequential approach. good for projects with clear, unchanging requirements for example building a bridge.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- writes and maintains code.
Quality Assurance Engineer-Tests software for bugs and ensures quality.
Project Manager- oversees the project, manages timelines, coordinates the team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs- Provide tools for coding, debugging, and testing in one place.
VCS-track changes, enable collaboration, and prevent data loss.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
challenge- changing requirements 
solution: Use Agile methodologies 
challenge- tight deadlines 
solution: Prioritize tasks and use time management tools.
challenge-bugs and errors 
solution: Implement thorough testing and code reviews.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing - tests individual components.
integration testing - checks how components work together.
system testing - testing the entire system.
Acceptance testing- ensures the software meets user requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves crafting clear and effective inputs to guide AI models to produce desired output.
it is important because it improves the accuracy and relevance of AI responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt- tells us about computer.
Improved Prompt- explain he differences between RAM and ROM in the computer in 2-3 sentences.
Vague- prompt is too broad and lack dirextion. the AI could respond with anyting from the historyof computer to how they work.
improved Prompt- clear= it specifies the topics (RAM vs ROM)
                - Specific= it asks for a concise comparison.
                concise = it limits the response length,ensuring a focused answer.
